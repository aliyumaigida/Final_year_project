This project is a Breast Cancer Prediction System developed using machine learning algorithms to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The project uses a dataset sourced from Kaggle and employs multiple machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, SVC, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and a deep learning model with CNN (Conv1D) for more advanced predictions.

The system is built using Django and Django REST Framework for backend API development, with a responsive frontend powered by HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
